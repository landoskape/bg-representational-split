# bg-representational-split
 
This is a simple repository designed to explore an idea related to some data collected in my lab.


## Installation
To run this yourself, use the ``environment.yml`` file to create a conda environment. Note that you
may need to comment out the pytorch packages and use the instructions on the website to get it started.

Then open up the [workspace](workspace.ipynb) notebook to run the code yourself. 

## Results
The results are in the [workspace](workspace.ipynb) notebook prerun and uploaded. If they aren't there
and you can't rerun it yourself, yell at me.
